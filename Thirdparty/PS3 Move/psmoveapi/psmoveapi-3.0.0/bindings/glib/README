GLib bindings for PS Move API
=============================

Incomplete, experimental GLib bindings with GIR support.
Based on: http://live.gnome.org/Vala/SharedLibSample


How to build:

 $ sh build.sh

To set up environment variables:

 $ source env.sh

Now you can use either GJS or Python to run the examples:

 $ gjs PsMoveApi.js
 $ python PsMoveApi.py

As of 2011-12-03, the Python interface does not yet work, but the JS
interface seems to work without problems. This is most likely a bug in
the Python GObject bindings. The JavaScript (GJS) interface does work
and was tested, although as you can see the GLib bindings are incomplete.


TODO:

 * Complete the bindings for all properties
 * Make the Python bindings work
 * Port other examples (from ../c/ and ../python/) to JavaScript
 * Convert build.sh, env.sh and clean.sh to CMakeLists.txt
 * Provide support for system-wide installation
