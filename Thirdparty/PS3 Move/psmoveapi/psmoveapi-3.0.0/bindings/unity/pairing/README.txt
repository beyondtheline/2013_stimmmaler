------------------------------------------
  INTRODUCTION
------------------------------------------

This Pairing Utility is an open-source C# application that pairs
PlayStation Move controllers by Bluetooth to your computer.

It was built using Unity (http://unity3d.com) and is licensed under 
the GNU Lesser General Public License (v2.1 or later) (see COPYING). 
It is still under development.

For more information, see the UniMove README.


--------------------------------
  SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------

The Pairing Utility runs only on OSX 10.5 and 10.6 (it has not 
been tested on OSX 10.4 or earlier, but I'd be curious to hear if 
that actually works).

The Utility requires a Bluetooth connection, and requires one or
more PlayStation Move controllers. You'll also need a mini-USB
wire for the initial connection (once the controller is 
paired, you'll be able to unplug it and use it wirelessly).


--------------------------------
  INSTALLATION & HOW TO USE
--------------------------------

There is no "installation" per se. Just double click the 
"Pairing Utility" application executable. 

Follow the directions in the application.

The process of "pairing" writes the Bluetooth address of your 
computer (or console) into the controller's memory. This means 
that you won't have to re-pair the controller, even if you restart 
your computer. HOWEVER, if you pair the controller to a new computer 
or to a Playstation 3, you will have to re-pair. 

And remember to turn on Bluetooth on your computer BEFORE 
starting the application!


--------------------------------
  SOURCE CODE
--------------------------------

The Unity files and source code have been included, but without
the music, sound effects, or fonts used in our release executable
(for permissions reasons).

To get the source code running, you'll need a copy of Unity Pro
(only the Pro version lets you use external libraries).

1. Start a new project, then go to: 
Assets --> Import Package --> Custom Package…

2. Find and select PairingUtility.package

3. In the "Importing package" window, press the "Import" button
in the bottom right

4. Viola! The assets (code, scene, plugin) should now be extracted and visible 
in your Project window. Double click the "Pairing Utility" scene to load it. 
You should now be able to press the Play button to run the utility.

We've also included the code in a separate directory, just in case.

For more information on using C# bindings outside of Unity,
see the UniMove README.
