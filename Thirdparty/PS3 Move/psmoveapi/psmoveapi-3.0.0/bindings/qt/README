PSMoveAPI Qt bindings / QML Example
-----------------------------------

These are the Qt bindings for the PS Move API, which provides a QObject-based
library for accessing and controlling the PS Move Motion controller, with
properties, signals and slots, so you can use the controller inside QML.

An example QML application exists that shows you how you can access the PSMove
from within QML (setting LEDs/rumble and reading trigger values, etc..).

Be aware that you have to set "enabled" to True in order to get sensor readings
from the motion controller. Also, this only works if the controller is
connected via Bluetooth. If the controller is connected via USB, you can't yet
get any sensor readings, but you can set the LED and Rumble values.
